title: "Robot Detection and Localization based on Deep Learning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/CAC2017
excerpt: "In this paper, we propose a novel approach for robot detection and 
localization based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for RoboCup MSL soccer robots. The approach is composed of two stages: robot detection 
using the RGB image, and robot localization using the depth point cloud. The high accuracy and mean average precision (mAP) verify that the 
proposed method is suitable for robot detection during the MSL competition, which will benifit the following strategy design and obstacle 
avoidance procedures."
