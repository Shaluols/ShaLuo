I am a third year PhD candidate at the Department of Artificial Intelligence, University of Groningen under the supervison of [prof. dr. Lambert Schomaker](https://www.ai.rug.nl/~lambert/) and [prof. dr. Hamidreza Kasaei](https://hkasaei.github.io/). My research is related to Reinforcement Learning, Motion Planning and Robotics, specially reinforcement learning based motion planning on multi-DoFs robot arms. Prior to my PhD study, I have two years experience in objects detection and localization with deep learning. My matser thesis was mainly about parallel computing of image processing.

I enjoy cooking, jogging and playing piano in my free time.
